DiscoGAN
=========================================

Tensorflow implementation of [Learning to Discover Cross-Domain Relations
with Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05192.pdf). 

### Recent development 

Our NIPS paper [**ALICE**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01215) improves DiscoGAN/CycleGAN/DualGAN, please see [its code repo](https://github.com/ChunyuanLI/ALICE), and [comparison on cartoon generation](https://github.com/ChunyuanLI/Alice4Alice).

Prerequisites
-------------
   - Python 3.5
   - Tensorflow 1.0
   - Others
   
### 5-GMM to 2-GMM

The demo is tested a toy dataset, with domain X as 5-component GMM, and domain Z as 2-component GMM. It can be easily extended to other GMM settings, and real dataset.

To train:

    $ python DiscoGAN_main.py
    
The reuslts:
